  Ensure API keys are restricted to use by only specified Hosts and Apps
description: >
  Security risks involved in using API-Keys appear below:
  - API keys are simple encrypted strings
  - API keys do not identify the user or the application making the API request
  - API keys are typically accessible to clients, making it easy to discover and steal an API key
  In order to reduce attack vectors, API-Keys can be restricted only to trusted hosts, HTTP referrers and applications.
  By default, Application Restrictions are set to None.
