  The "3625 (trace flag)" database flag for Cloud SQL, SQL Server instance is set to "on"
description: >
  Setting this trace flag to a Google Cloud SQL Server database instance allows for security through obscurity and prevents the disclosure of sensitive information. 
  It is strongly recommended to set this flag globally to "off" in order to prevent the flag having been left on, or turned on by malicious actors.
