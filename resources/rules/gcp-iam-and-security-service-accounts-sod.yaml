  Ensure that Separation of duties is enforced while assigning service account related roles to users
description: >
  Separation of duties is the concept of ensuring that one individual does not have all necessary permissions to be able to complete a malicious action.
  In Cloud IAM service accounts, this could be an action such as using a service account to access resources that user should not normally have access to.
  Best pracitce suggests that no user should have Service Account Admin and Service Account Userroles assigned at the same time.
