  The "log_min_duration_statement" database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to "0" (enabled)
description: >
  The "log_min_duration_statement" flag causes the duration of each completed SQL statement to be logged if the statement executes for at least the specified number of milliseconds. 
  Setting this flag to "0" logs all statement durations, whereas setting it to "-1" disables logging statement durations. 
  Logging SQL statements may include sensitive information that should not be recorded in log files, therefore the "log_min_duration_statement" database flag should be disabled or set to "-1".
  By default, "log_min_duration_statement" is -1.
