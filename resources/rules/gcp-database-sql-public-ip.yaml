  Cloud SQL database instances have public IP addresses
description: >
  To lower the organization's attack surface, Cloud SQL databases should not have public IP addresses.
  Private IPs provide improved network security and lower latency for your application.
  It is recommended to configure Second Generation Sql instances to use private IPs instead of public IPs.
  Please note that an instance can have both a private and public address at the same time and that you cannot use private IPs with First Generation instances.
