  Log sinks are not configured for all log entries
description: >
  It is recommended to create a sink that will export copies of all the log entries to ensure visibility.
  This can help aggregate logs from multiple projects and export them to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for analysis.
  By default, there are no log sinks configured.
