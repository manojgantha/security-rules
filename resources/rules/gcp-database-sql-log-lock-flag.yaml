  The "log_lock_waits" database flag for a Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to "off"
description: >
  Enabling the "log_lock_waits" flag for a PostgreSQL instance creates a log
  for any session waits that take longer than the alloted "deadlock_timeout" time to acquire a lock.
  This can be used to identify poor performance due to locking delays
  or, identify specially-crafted SQL queries attempting to starve resources through holding locks for excessive amounts of time.
  By default, "log_lock_waits" is off.
