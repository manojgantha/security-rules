  Legacy networks have a single network IPv4 prefix range and a single gateway IP address for the whole network.
  The network is global in scope and spans all cloud regions.
  Subnetworks cannot be created in a legacy network and are unable to switch from legacy to auto or custom subnet networks.
  Legacy networks can have an impact for high network traffic projects and are subject to a single point of contention or failure.
