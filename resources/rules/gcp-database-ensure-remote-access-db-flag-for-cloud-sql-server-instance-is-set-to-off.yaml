  The "remote access database flag for Cloud SQL, SQL Server instance is set to "on"
description: >
  The "remote access" option controls the execution of stored procedures from local or remote servers on which SQL Servier instances are running.
  The default value for this option is "1".
  To prevent locally stored procedures from being run from a remote server
  or remotely stored procedures from being run on the local server, this must be disabled.
  Additonally, remote access functionality can be abused to launch a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on remote servers
  by off-loading query processing to a target, hence this should be disabled.
