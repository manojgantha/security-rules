  Ensure 'user connections' database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance is set as appropriate
description: >
  The user connections option specifies the maximum number of simultaneous user connections that are allowed on an instance of SQL Server.
  The actual number of user connections allowed also depends on the version of SQL Server that you are using,
  and also the limits of your application or applications and hardware. SQL Server allows a maximum of 32,767 user connections.
  Because user connections is a dynamic (self-configuring) option,
  SQL Server adjusts the maximum number of user connections automatically as needed, up to the maximum value allowable.
  In most cases, you do not have to change the value for this option.
  The default is 0, which means that the maximum (32,767) user connections are allowed.
