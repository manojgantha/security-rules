  Firewall rules for Identity Aware Proxy are overly permissive
description: >
  IAP ensure that access to VMs is controlled by authenticating incoming requests.
  However if the VM is still accessible from IP addresses other than the IAP it may still be possible to send unauthenticated requests to the instance.
  Care must be taken to ensure that loadblancer health checks are not blocked as this would stop the loadbalancer from correctly knowing the health of the VM and loadbalancing correctly.
