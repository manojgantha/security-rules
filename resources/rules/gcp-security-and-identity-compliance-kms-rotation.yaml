  KMS encryption keys are not rotated within a period of 90 days
description: >
  A key is used to protect data. A collection of files could be encrypted with the same key and people with decrypt permissions on that key would be able to decrypt those files.
  Therefore, best practice suggests ensuring a rotation period is set to a specific time, ideally 90 days or less.
  By default, KMS encryption keys are rotated every 90 days (7776000 seconds).
