  Cross DB ownership chaining opens up attack vectors
description: >
  The "cross db ownership chaining" configuration flag allows you to control cross-database ownership chaining at the SQL Server database level or to allow cross-database ownership chaining for all SQL Server databases. 
  Enabling "cross db ownership chaining" flag is not recommended unless all of the databases hosted by the SQL Server need to participate in cross-database ownership chaining and you are fully aware of the security implications of this configuration setting.
