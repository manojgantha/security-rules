  The "cross db ownership chaining" database flag for Cloud SQL, SQL Server instance is set to "on"
description: >
  Use the "cross db ownership for chaining" option to configure cross-database ownership chaining for an instance of Microsoft SQL Server.
  This server option allows you to control cross-database ownership chaining at the database level
  or allow cross-database ownership chaining for all databases.
  Enabling cross db ownership is not recommended unless all of the databases hosted by the SQL server instance
  must participate in cross-database ownership chaining and you are aware of the security implications of this setting.
