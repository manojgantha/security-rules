  Legacy networks exist for a project
description: >
  Legacy networks are not recommended by Google Cloud and can no longer be created. 
  Many newer Google Cloud features are not supported in legacy networks. Instead, use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks.
  For a legacy network, you can explicitly delete the network only if the network is not in use by any resources.
  Consider migrating over any important resources that are still on a legacy network.
