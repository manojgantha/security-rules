description: >
  Default network is an auto mode network, which means that its subnets use the same predefined range of IP addresses,
  and as a result, it's not possible to use Cloud VPN or VPC Network Peering with the default network.
  Based on organization security and networking requirements, the organization should create a new network and delete the default network.
