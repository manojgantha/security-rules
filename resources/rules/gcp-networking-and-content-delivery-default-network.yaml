  The default network does exist in a project
description: >
  The default network has a pre-configured network configuration and automatically generates the following insecure firewall rules:
  
  default-allow-internal: Allows ingress connections for all protocols and ports among instances in the network.
  default-allow-ssh: Allows ingress connections on TCP port 22(SSH) from any source to any instance in the network.
  default-allow-rdp: Allows ingress connections on TCP port 3389(RDP) from any source to any instance in the network.
  default-allow-icmp: Allows ingress ICMP traffic from any source to any instance in the network.

  We recommend that a project should not have a default network to prevent use of default network. Also, it's not possible to use Cloud VPN or VPC Network Peering within the default network.
  Based on organization security and networking requirements, the organization should create a new network and delete the default network.
