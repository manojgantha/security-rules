  IAM instance roles are used for AWS resource access from instances
description: >
  AWS access from within AWS instances can be done by either encoding AWS keys into AWS
  API calls or by assigning the instance to a role which has an appropriate permissions policy
  for the required access. "AWS Access" means accessing the APIs of AWS in order to access
  AWS resources or manage AWS account resources.
