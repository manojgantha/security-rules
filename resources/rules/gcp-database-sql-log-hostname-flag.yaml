  The "log_hostname" database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is not set appropriately
description: >
  Logging hostnames can incur overhead on server performance since each statement logged,
  rquires DNS resolution to convert IP addresses to hostnames.
  Depending on the setup, this may be non-negligible.
  Additionally, the IP addresses that are logged can be resolved to their DNS names later
  when reviewing the logs excluding the cases where dynamic hostnames are used.
  By default, "log_hostname" is off.
