  MFA is not enabled for IAM Users with console passwords
description: >
  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user name
  and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be
  prompted for their user name and password as well as for an authentication code from
  their AWS MFA device. It is recommended that MFA be enabled for all accounts that have a
  console password.
