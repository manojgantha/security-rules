  Cloud SQL database instance does not require all incoming connections to use SSL
description: >
  SQL database connections, if successfully trapped using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, can reveal sensitive data like credentials, database queries, query outputs, etc.
  For security, it is recommended to always use SSL encryption when connecting to your instance to protect communication.
  This recommendation is applicable for Postgresql, MySql generation 1, MySql generation 2 and SQL Server 2017 instances.
