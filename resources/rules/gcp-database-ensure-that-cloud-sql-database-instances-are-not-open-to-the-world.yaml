  Cloud SQL database instances are accessible to the internet
description: >
  To minimize the attack surface on a database server instance, only trusted/known and required IP addresses should be white-listed to connect to it.
  An authorized network should not have IPs/networks configured to 0.0.0.0/0 which allows access to the instance from anywhere in the world.
  Note that authorized networks apply only to instances with public IPs addresses.
