  Elasticsearch instance potentially exposed due to security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 9200
description: >
  This rule identifies potentially exposed Elasticsearch instances due to security groups which allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 9200. Unrestricted connectivity to Elasticsearch, increases a resource's exposure to risk.

  Restrict the security group ingress to specific IP ranges for port 9200 rather than the full internet.
