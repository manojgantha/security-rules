  Ensure API keys are rotated every 90 days
description: >
  Once a key is stolen, it has no expiration, meaning it may be used indefinitely unless the project owner revokes or regenerates the key.
  Rotating API keys will reduce the window of opportunity for an access key that is associated with a compromised or terminated account to be used.
  API keys should be rotated to ensure that data cannot be accessed with an old key that might have been lost, cracked, or stolen.
