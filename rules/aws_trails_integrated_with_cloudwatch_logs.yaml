  Ensure CloudTrail trails are integrated with CloudWatch Logs
description: >
  AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls made in a given AWS account.
  The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the
  source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the response elements
  returned by the AWS service. CloudTrail uses Amazon S3 for log file storage and delivery,
  so log files are stored durably. In addition to capturing CloudTrail logs within a specified S3
  bucket for long term analysis, realtime analysis can be performed by configuring CloudTrail
  to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. For a trail that is enabled in all regions in an account,
  CloudTrail sends log files from all those regions to a CloudWatch Logs log group. It is
  recommended that CloudTrail logs be sent to CloudWatch Logs

  Perform the following to establish the prescribed state:
  Via the AWS management Console
    1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at

    2. Under All Buckets, click on the target bucket you wish to evaluate
    3. Click Properties on the top right of the console
    4. Click Trails in the left menu
    5. Click on each trail where no CloudWatch Logs are defined
    6. Go to the CloudWatch Logs section and click on Configure
    7. Define a new or select an existing log group
    8. Click on Continue
    9. Configure IAM Role which will deliver CloudTrail events to CloudWatch Logs
      o Create/Select an IAM Role and Policy Name
      o Click Allow to continue
  Via CLI
    aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail_name> --cloudwatch-logs-log-grouparn <cloudtrail_log_group_arn> --cloudwatch-logs-role-arn
    <cloudtrail_cloudwatchLogs_role_arn>
