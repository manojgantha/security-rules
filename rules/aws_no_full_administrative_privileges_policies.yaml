  Ensure IAM policies that allow full "*:*" administrative privileges
  are not created
description: >
  IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is
  recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant least privilegeâ€”that is,
  granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users need to do
  and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks, instead of
  allowing full administrative privileges.

     aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name <iam_user> --policy-arn <policy_arn>
    3. Detach the policy from all IAM Groups:
     aws iam detach-group-policy --group-name <iam_group> --policy-arn <policy_arn>
