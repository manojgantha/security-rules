  Ensure that Compute instances have Confidential Computing enabled
description: >
  Confidential Computing enables customers' sensitive code and other data encrypted in memory during processing.
  Google does not have access to the encryption keys.
  Confidential VM can help alleviate concerns about risk related to either dependency on Google infrastructure
  or Google insiders' access to customer data in the clear.
  Note: Confidential Computing is currently only supported on N2D machines
