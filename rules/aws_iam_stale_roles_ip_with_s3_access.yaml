  1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
  2. In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose Roles. Then select the check box next to the role name that you want to delete, not the name or row itself.
  3. For Role actions at the top of the page, choose Delete.
  4. In the confirmation dialog box, review the last accessed information, which shows when each of the selected roles last accessed an AWS service.
      This helps you to confirm whether the role is currently active. If you want to proceed, choose Yes, Delete to submit the service-linked role for deletion.
  5. Watch the IAM console notifications to monitor the progress of the service-linked role deletion.
    Because the IAM service-linked role deletion is asynchronous, after you submit the role for deletion, the deletion task can succeed or fail.
    If the task succeeds, then the role is removed from the list and a notification of success appears at the top of the page.
    If the task fails, you can choose View details or View Resources from the notifications to learn why the deletion failed.
    If the deletion fails because the role is using the service's resources, then the notification includes a list of resources, if the service returns that information.
    You can then clean up the resources and submit the deletion again.
