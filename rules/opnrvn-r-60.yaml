  Ensure CloudTrail trails are integrated with CloudWatch Logs
description: >
  AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls made in a given AWS account.
  The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the
  source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the response elements
  returned by the AWS service. CloudTrail uses Amazon S3 for log file storage and delivery,
  so log files are stored durably. In addition to capturing CloudTrail logs within a specified S3
  bucket for long term analysis, realtime analysis can be performed by configuring CloudTrail
  to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. For a trail that is enabled in all regions in an account,
  CloudTrail sends log files from all those regions to a CloudWatch Logs log group. It is
  recommended that CloudTrail logs be sent to CloudWatch Logs
