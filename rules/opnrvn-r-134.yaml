  Ensure that the 'cross db ownership chaining' database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance is set to 'off'
description: >
  Use the cross db ownership for chaining option to configure cross-database ownership chaining for an instance of Microsoft SQL Server.
  This server option allows you to control cross-database ownership chaining at the database level
  or to allow cross-database ownership chaining for all databases.
  Enabling cross db ownership is not recommended unless all of the databases hosted by the instance of SQL Server
  must participate in cross- database ownership chaining and you are aware of the security implications of this setting.
