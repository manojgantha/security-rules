  Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
description: >
  AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your account and delivers
  log files to you. The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of
  the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the
  response elements returned by the AWS service. CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API
  calls for an account, including API calls made via the Management Console, SDKs, command
  line tools, and higher-level AWS services (such as CloudFormation)

    3. Click Get Started Now , if presented
       Click Add new trail
       Enter a trail name in the Trail name box
       Set the Apply trail to all regions option to Yes
       Specify an S3 bucket name in the S3 bucket box
       Click Create
    4. If 1 or more trails already exist, select the target trail to enable for global logging
    5. Click the edit icon (pencil) next to Apply trail to all regions , Click Yes and
    Click Save.
    6. Click the edit icon (pencil) next to Management Events click All for setting
