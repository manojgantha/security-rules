  Ensure hardware MFA is enabled for the "root" account
description: >
  The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of
  protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to
  an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an
  authentication code from their AWS MFA device. For Level 2, it is recommended that the
  root account be protected with a hardware MFA.

  Perform the following to establish a hardware MFA for the root account:
    1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
    Note: to manage MFA devices for the root AWS account, you must use your root account
    credentials to sign in to AWS. You cannot manage MFA devices for the root account using
    other credentials.
    2. Choose Dashboard , and under Security Status , expand Activate MFA on your root
    account.
    3. Choose Activate MFA
    4. In the wizard, choose A hardware MFA device and then choose Next Step .
    5. In the Serial Number box, enter the serial number that is found on the back of the MFA
    device.
    6. In the Authentication Code 1 box, enter the six-digit number displayed by the MFA
    device. You might need to press the button on the front of the device to display the number.
    7. Wait 30 seconds while the device refreshes the code, and then enter the next six-digit
    number into the Authentication Code 2 box. You might need to press the button on the
    front of the device again to display the second number.
    8. Choose Next Step . The MFA device is now associated with the AWS account. The next
    time you use your AWS account credentials to sign in, you must type a code from the
    hardware MFA device.
