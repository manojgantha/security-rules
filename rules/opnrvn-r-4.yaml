  Ensure CloudTrail log file validation is enabled
description: >
  CloudTrail log file validation creates a digitally signed digest file containing a hash of each
  log that CloudTrail writes to S3. These digest files can be used to determine whether a log
  file was changed, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered the log. It is
  recommended that file validation be enabled on all CloudTrails
