  Using the Amazon unified command line interface:
  - Create an IAM role for managing incidents with AWS:
    - Create a trust relationship policy document that allows <iam_user> to
    manage AWS incidents, and save it locally as /tmp/TrustPolicy.json:
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::321859670049:root" },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }
    - Create the IAM role using the above trust policy:
    aws iam create-role --role-name <aws_support_iam_role> --assume-rolepolicy-document file:///tmp/TrustPolicy.json
    - Attach 'AWSSupportAccess' managed policy to the created IAM role:
    aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn <iam_policy_arn> --role-name <aws_support_iam_role>
