  Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest using KMS CMKs
description: >
  AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for an account and makes those
  logs available to users and resources in accordance with IAM policies. AWS Key
  Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that helps create and control the
  encryption keys used to encrypt account data, and uses Hardware Security Modules
  (HSMs) to protect the security of encryption keys. CloudTrail logs can be configured to
  leverage server side encryption (SSE) and KMS customer created master keys (CMK) to
  further protect CloudTrail logs. It is recommended that CloudTrail be configured to use
  SSE-KMS
