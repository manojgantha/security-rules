  Ensure IAM instance roles are used for AWS resource access from instances
description: >
  AWS access from within AWS instances can be done by either encoding AWS keys into AWS
  API calls or by assigning the instance to a role which has an appropriate permissions policy
  for the required access. "AWS Access" means accessing the APIs of AWS in order to access
  AWS resources or manage AWS account resources.

  IAM roles can only be associated at the launch of an instance. To remediate an instance to
  add it to a role you must create a new instance.
  If the instance has no external dependencies on its current private ip or public addresses
  are elastic IPs:
    1. In AWS IAM create a new role. Assign a permissions policy if needed permissions
    are already known.
    2. In the AWS console launch a new instance with identical settings to the existing
    instance, and ensure that the newly created role is selected.
    3. Shutdown both the existing instance and the new instance.
    4. Detach disks from both instances.
    5. Attach the existing instance disks to the new instance.
    6. Boot the new instance and you should have the same machine, but with the
    associated role.
  Note: if your environment has dependencies on a dynamically assigned PRIVATE IP
  address you can create an AMI from the existing instance, destroy the old one and then
  when launching from the AMI, manually assign the previous private IP address.
  Note: if your environment has dependencies on a dynamically assigned PUBLIC IP address
  there is not a way ensure the address is retained and assign an instance role. Dependencies
  on dynamically assigned public IP addresses are a bad practice and, if possible, you may
  wish to rebuild the instance with a new elastic IP address and make the investment to
  remediate affected systems while assigning the system to a role.
