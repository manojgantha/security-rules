  Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket
description: >
  S3 Bucket Access Logging generates a log that contains access records for each request
  made to your S3 bucket. An access log record contains details about the request, such as the
  request type, the resources specified in the request worked, and the time and date the
  request was processed. It is recommended that bucket access logging be enabled on the
  CloudTrail S3 bucket
