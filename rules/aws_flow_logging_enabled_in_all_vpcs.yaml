  Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs
description: >
  VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic
  going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. After you've created a flow log, you can
  view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. It is recommended that VPC Flow
  Logs be enabled for packet "Rejects" for VPCs.

  Perform the following to determine if VPC Flow logs is enabled:
  Via the Management Console:
    1. Sign into the management console
    2. Select Services then VPC
    3. In the left navigation pane, select Your VPCs
    4. Select a VPC
    5. In the right pane, select the Flow Logs tab.
    6. If no Flow Log exists, click Create Flow Log
    7. For Filter, select Reject
    8. Enter in a Role and Destination Log Group
    9. Click Create Log Flow
    10. Click on CloudWatch Logs Group
  Note:
    Setting the filter to "Reject" will dramatically reduce the logging data accumulation
    for this recommendation and provide sufficient information for the purposes of breach
    detection, research and remediation. However, during periods of least privilege security
    group engineering, setting this the filter to "All" can be very helpful in discovering existing
    traffic flows required for proper operation of an already running environment.
  Impact:
    By default, CloudWatch Logs will store Logs indefinitely unless a specific retention period
    is defined for the log group. When choosing the number of days to retain, keep in mind the
    average days it takes an organization to realize they have been breached is 210 days (at the
    time of this writing). Since additional time is required to research a breach, a minimum 365
    day retention policy allows time for detection and research. You may also wish to archive
    the logs to a cheaper storage service rather than simply deleting them. See the following
    AWS resource to manage CloudWatch Logs retention periods:
