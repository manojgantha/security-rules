  Ensure KMS encryption keys are rotated within a period of 90 days
description: >
  A key is used to protect some corpus of data.
  A collection of files could be encrypted with the same key and people with decrypt permissions on that key would be able to decrypt those files.
  Therefore, it's necessary to make sure the rotation period is set to a specific time
  By default, KMS encryption keys are rotated every 90 days (7776000 seconds)
