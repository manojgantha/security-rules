  Maintain current contact details
description: >
  Ensure contact email and telephone details for AWS accounts are current and map to more
  than one individual in your organization.
  An AWS account supports a number of contact details, and AWS will use these to contact
  the account owner if activity judged to be in breach of Acceptable Use Policy or indicative
  of likely security compromise is observed by the AWS Abuse team. Contact details should
  not be for a single individual, as circumstances may arise where that individual is
  unavailable. Email contact details should point to a mail alias which forwards email to
  multiple individuals within the organization; where feasible, phone contact details should
  point to a PABX hunt group or other call-forwarding system.
