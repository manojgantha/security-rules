  Ensure API keys are restricted to only APIs that application needs access
description: >
  Security risks involved in using API-Keys appear below:
  - API keys are simple encrypted strings
  - API keys do not identify the user or the application making the API request
  - API keys are typically accessible to clients, making it easy to discover and steal an API key
  In order to reduce attack surfaces by providing least privileges,
  API-Keys can be restricted to use (call) only APIs required by an application.
  By default, API restrictions are set to None.
