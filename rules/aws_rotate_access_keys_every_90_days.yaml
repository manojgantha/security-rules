  Ensure access keys are rotated every 90 days or less
description: >
  Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign
  programmatic requests that you make to AWS. AWS users need their own access keys to
  make programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), Tools
  for Windows PowerShell, the AWS SDKs, or direct HTTP calls using the APIs for individual
  AWS services. It is recommended that all access keys be regularly rotated.
